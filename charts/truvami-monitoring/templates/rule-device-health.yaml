              **What's happening:** Device {{ "{{" }} $labels.devEui }} on port {{ "{{" }} $labels.port }} is experiencing high payload decoding failures (>0.1 failures/sec over 5 minutes).
              
              **Why this occurred:** The system tracks decoding failures using rate(truvami_failed_to_decode_payload_count[5m])
              which measures how often received device payloads cannot be properly decoded. Common causes include:
              - Device firmware changes affecting payload format
              - Corrupted or incomplete data transmission
              - Decoder configuration mismatch with device version
              - Device hardware malfunction affecting data encoding
              - Network interference causing data corruption
              - Device battery issues affecting transmission quality
              
              **What to do:**
              1. Check device firmware version and decoder compatibility
              2. Verify device hardware health and battery status
              3. Review recent decoder configuration changes
              4. Check network signal quality (RSSI/SNR) for this device
              5. Examine raw payload data for corruption patterns
              6. Consider device replacement if hardware failure suspected
              7. Update decoder if device firmware was recently changed

              **Why this occurred:** The system monitors battery voltage using truvami_device_battery_status < 3.0
              which triggers when battery voltage drops below 3.0V, indicating approximately 20% battery remaining.
              This is normal battery depletion over time, but requires attention to prevent service interruption.
              
              **What to do:**
              1. **Schedule battery replacement** within next 2-4 weeks
              2. Contact customer {{ "{{" }} $labels.customer }} to arrange maintenance
              3. Monitor device for further battery degradation
              4. Check if device location is accessible for maintenance
              5. Verify customer maintenance contract and procedures
              6. Document maintenance schedule to prevent service interruption
              7. Consider proactive replacement if device is in critical location

              **Why this occurred:** The system monitors critical battery levels using truvami_device_battery_status < 2.7

              Device will likely stop functioning within days or hours, causing service disruption.
              
              **What to do IMMEDIATELY:**
              1. **URGENT:** Schedule emergency battery replacement within 24-48 hours
              2. **Contact customer immediately** to arrange urgent maintenance access
              3. **Escalate to field service team** for priority dispatch
              4. Monitor device for complete power failure
              5. Prepare backup communication methods if device fails
              6. Document incident for customer service follow-up
              7. Review why earlier low battery alerts weren't addressed
              8. Consider temporary service arrangements if replacement delayed

              **What's happening:** Device {{ "{{" }} $labels.devEui }} has been detected transmitting on multiple LoRa networks over the past 7 days.
              
              **Why this occurred:** The query detects devices that have uplinks on both standard gateway IDs (8-character hex format) 
              and non-standard gateway IDs within a 7-day window. This indicates the device may be switching between different 
              LoRa network configurations with every reset, creating unpredictable network behavior.
              
              Standard networks use 8-character hexadecimal gateway IDs (e.g., "12AB34CD"), while other networks may use 
              different ID formats. When a device transmits on both types, it suggests dual provisioning or network switching.
              
              **Expected behavior after network migration:** If this alert triggered due to an intentional network change, 
              it will automatically clear after 7 days when the old network data expires from the monitoring window.
              
              **What to do:**
              1. **If network change was intentional** - Wait for alert to auto-clear in 7 days, no action needed
              2. **If unintentional** - Verify device provisioning and check if accidentally provisioned on multiple networks
              3. **Review network configuration** - Ensure device is configured for single network operation
              4. **Check device firmware** - Verify firmware isn't causing network switching behavior
              5. **Monitor device resets** - Correlate with reset patterns to identify switching triggers
              6. **Update network credentials** - Remove device from unintended networks if dual-provisioned
              7. **Contact customer** to verify intended network configuration
              8. **Document network assignment** to prevent future multi-provisioning
